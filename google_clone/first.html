    <h1> HAZEL</h1>
    <p1>DURING THE THIRD ATTACK, Hazel almost ate a boulder. She was peering
        into the fog, wondering how it could be so difficult to fly across one stupid
        mountain range, when the ship’s alarm bells sounded.
        “Hard to port!” Nico yelled from the foremast of the flying ship.
        Back at the helm, Leo yanked the wheel. The Argo II veered left, its
        aerial oars slashing through the clouds like rows of knives.
        Hazel made the mistake of looking over the rail. A dark spherical
        shape hurtled toward her. She thought: Why is the moon coming at us?
        Then she yelped and hit the deck. The huge rock passed so close overhead
        it blew her hair out of her face.
        CRACK!
